# Introduction

This is a small form factor VCO board. It is designed to be modular so it is possible to add or remove certain functions to build a customized module.
It is based around the popular CEM3340 chip. In its fully populated configuration, it has the following features:
- Ramp, triangle, and square waveform outputs.
- Voltage controlled pulse width modulation for the square waveform output.
- 1 volt per octave control voltage input.
- Linear frequency modulation input.
- Accurate tracking over at least 7 octaves.

# Design

The circuit is based around the popular CEM3340 voltage controlled oscillator chip. It is also compatible with the AS3340 and V3340 chip. It has two trimmer potentiometers for adjusting the 1v/octave tracking. All waveform outputs are buffered via the TL074 quad op amp chip. A full schematic is shown below.
