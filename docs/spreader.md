# Introduction

This is a CV-controlled 'spread' module for providing evenly offset control voltages, perfect for detuning oscillators or equally varying filter cutoffs.

It takes a CV input. A 'spread' value is then:
- added to the CV input and sent to the + output
- subtracted from the CV input and sent to the - output

The CV input is also buffered and sent to the Buffer output.

The spread value is determined by adding together the value of the Spread knob (ranging from 0 to 12V) and the value of the Spread CV input (attenuated by the CV ATT knob).
