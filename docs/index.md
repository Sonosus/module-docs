## Module Docs

## Introduction

On this site I aim to collate all of the documentation for my synth-DIY related ventures into one cohesive, usable package. This process will take some time as I transfer, edit, and improve the documentation for my existing projects which at present are not all equally documented, leading to confusion and a difficult experience for first time builders.
